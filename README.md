# Game-Design-Document---Cosmic-Frontiers
- Contents:
- Brief Introduction of the Game Concept for a game with the Tab to Blast mechanics
- Gameplay mechanics for the first 50 levels (Obstacles, Power-Ups, and
Boosters)
- Concept Ideas for Basic Match Elements, Power Ups, Boosters, and Obstacles
- Meta-Game Design
- Level Design Strategy
- Home Screen UI Design and Gameplay Screen UI Design (Wireframe)

  This project was created for a case study, so:
- There was no need to analyze or include the events (time-based features, tournaments, etc.)
- There was no need to draw anything other than the wireframe for UI Designs. The concept ideas could be referenced with images.
